        <h1>Officina vs. Meta </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Officina</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
            
             <p>Officina was released in 1990. It was available as a serif or sans serif font. It was designed by famed German type designer Erik Spiekermann. While it was designed by the same man at about the same time as Meta, Officina bears several important differences, both in purpose and design. While Meta was designed to be printed on a wide variety of papers, including ones that are difficult to print on, Officina was a response to the rise in popularity and availability of cheap laser printers. Officina was originally meant for a business setting, but wound up gaining wide popularity in many sectors. In response to this widespread usage, Spiekermann designed and released a variety of weights for the font, to supplement the original two.

			 <h3>Meta</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Meta was originally designed in the 1980s for the Deutsche Bundespost—the West German Post Office—but they ultimately rejected the design and went with a different font for their services. Designer Erik Spiekermann then went on to release the font himself in 1991. Meta was designed to be legible even when printed on difficult papers as well as on a computer screen. The font became hugely popular and has been referred to as the “Helvetica of the 90s.” This is somewhat ironic, as the designer intended the font to be the antithesis of Helvetica, which he thought was a boring font. Spiekermann went on to release many more weights, styles, and variations of the font between 1992 and 2005, resulting in a large font family that can be used in many different contexts.
